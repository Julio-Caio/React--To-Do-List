# About the Project

This project aimed to create a To-Do List where users can add their notes or task lists, remove them, and mark them as completed. Additionally, it includes the option to filter and search for these notes. The application was built using React.js, utilizing the useState hook for component state management, the React-icons package, and CSS3 for component styling.
